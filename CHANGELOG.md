## [Unreleased]

- Print/PDF export renders iframe embeds as real page screenshots (captured at export time with headless Chromium) instead of Chromium's unreliable in-print frame rendering; a compact linked card is the fallback when a capture fails, and live HTML iframes are unchanged ([#51](https://github.com/natolambert/colloquium/pull/51))
- Fix captioned-figure fitting scaling images to the full cell height so the caption overflowed onto the footer: the fit pass now reserves the caption's height, and skips absolutely positioned figures so author CSS can own layout. Captioned solo figures render slightly smaller (image + caption now fit the cell together) ([#50](https://github.com/natolambert/colloquium/pull/50))
- Add opt-in `img-tall-right` slide class: on a columns slide, the right column's captioned figure runs from the slide top to the content bottom with the caption pinned beneath ([#50](https://github.com/natolambert/colloquium/pull/50))

## [0.2.3] - 2026-08-03

- Warn on stderr when a bibliography fails to parse (or pybtex is missing) instead of silently rendering every citation unresolved ([#48](https://github.com/natolambert/colloquium/pull/48))
- Fix a purely numeric `rows` count spec (e.g. a typo'd `rows: 100000000`) allocating a count-sized list and potentially exhausting memory during builds ([#47](https://github.com/natolambert/colloquium/pull/47))
- Cap printed row images at their row's height share (emitted as `--colloquium-print-row-frac`) so tall figures in `rows` slides stop overflowing the page and silently shifting onto the next PDF page during export ([#46](https://github.com/natolambert/colloquium/pull/46))
- Raise the PDF export virtual-time budget (5s → 30s, overridable via `COLLOQUIUM_PDF_TIME_BUDGET_MS`) so the last images in image-heavy decks stop rendering blank in exported PDFs ([#45](https://github.com/natolambert/colloquium/pull/45))
- Apply smart typography (en/em dashes, curly quotes) inside `box` and `conversation` elements by sharing the main pipeline's markdown-it config ([#44](https://github.com/natolambert/colloquium/pull/44))
- Fix paragraph spacing swallowed by generated step/animate fragment wrappers (stepped paragraphs rendered flush with no line break) ([#43](https://github.com/natolambert/colloquium/pull/43))
- Upgrade locked Pillow to 12.3.0 to fix 13 Dependabot alerts (heap OOB read/writes, decompression-bomb bypasses, DoS, command injection) ([#42](https://github.com/natolambert/colloquium/pull/42))
- Update presentation navigation: left/right step through reveal states then slides; up/down, typed slide numbers, and the picker jump straight to a slide with all reveals shown ([#39](https://github.com/natolambert/colloquium/pull/39))
- Load Google Fonts with a `<link>` in `<head>` so custom `fonts:` from the frontmatter actually render instead of silently falling back to the theme default ([#41](https://github.com/natolambert/colloquium/pull/41))

## [0.2.2] - 2026-06-19

- Make slide text easier to get out: click-drag/selection no longer advances the slide, and press `c` to copy the current slide's markdown source to the clipboard ([#37](https://github.com/natolambert/colloquium/pull/37))
- Fix `title: center` leaking center alignment to the whole slide body, and citation author surnames (keep full multi-word names, strip BibTeX braces) ([#36](https://github.com/natolambert/colloquium/pull/36))
- Fix block animations for generated div-based elements ([#33](https://github.com/natolambert/colloquium/pull/33))
- Bind dev server to loopback, change default port to 8090, and error on port conflicts ([#28](https://github.com/natolambert/colloquium/pull/28))
- Upgrade locked Pillow to 12.2.0 to fix CVE-2026-40192 ([#29](https://github.com/natolambert/colloquium/pull/29))
- Upgrade locked pytest to 9.0.3 and Pygments to 2.20.0 to fix CVE-2025-71176 and CVE-2026-4539 ([#30](https://github.com/natolambert/colloquium/pull/30))
- Upgrade locked lxml to 6.1.0 to fix CVE-2026-41066 (XXE in iterparse/ETCompatXMLParser) ([#31](https://github.com/natolambert/colloquium/pull/31))
- Add a built-in iframe element for embedding external or local HTML content ([#32](https://github.com/natolambert/colloquium/pull/32))
- Add fragment-based animations: `<!-- animate: bullets|blocks -->` and `<!-- step -->` for incremental reveal ([#25](https://github.com/natolambert/colloquium/pull/25))
- Hide the mobile slide picker trigger when decks are embedded in iframes ([#35](https://github.com/natolambert/colloquium/pull/35))
- Add `<!-- after: references -->` for post-reference appendix slides excluded from the footer total ([#34](https://github.com/natolambert/colloquium/pull/34))

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-25

- Add `colloquium capture` command for per-slide PNG export via Ghostscript ([#17](https://github.com/natolambert/colloquium/pull/17))
